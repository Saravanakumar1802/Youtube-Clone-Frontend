1. **Frontend (React.js and CSS)**:
   - **Homepage**: Display a list of uploaded videos.
   - **Video Player**: Create a component to play videos with controls for play, pause, and fullscreen.
   - **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
   - **Upload Form**: Develop a form for users to upload videos, including title, description, and thumbnail image.
   - **Redux: A state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state of your application in a predictable way, which is 
     crucial for large-scale applications

2. **Styling (CSS)**:
   - Design a responsive and user-friendly interface using CSS to ensure a consistent look and feel across different devices.
   - Create styles for video thumbnails, player controls, and other UI components.

3. **Backend (Node.js and Express.js)**:
   - **API Endpoints**: Set up Express.js routes to handle CRUD operations for videos. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting videos in the database.
   - **MongoDB Integration**: Use MongoDB to store video metadata, such as title, description, uploader information, and references to video files and thumbnail images.

4. **Firebase Storage for Videos and Images**:
   - Utilize Firebase Storage to store video files and thumbnail images securely. When a user uploads a video, store the video file in Firebase Storage and save the file URL or reference in the MongoDB database.
   - Handle user authentication to control access to upload and delete operations.

5. **Integration**:
   - Connect the frontend and backend by making API requests from React components to the Express.js server.
   - Implement logic to fetch and display video data dynamically on the front-end.

6. **Additional Features**:
   - **Comments and Likes**: Allow users to leave comments on videos and like or dislike them.
   - **Subscription System**: Implement a subscription system to enable users to follow channels and receive updates on new uploads.
   - **Search Functionality**: Develop a search feature to help users find specific videos based on keywords.
  
7. **Security and Permissions**:
   - Implement security measures to ensure that only authenticated users can upload videos.
